# Hajri Admin Portal - Development Roadmap

**Last Updated:** December 26, 2025  
**Status:** V2 Implementation Phase - Core Features Stabilized  
**Next Session:** Finalize deployment + User testing

---

## At a Glance

**What to do next (order matters)**
1. Smoke test the V2 workflow end-to-end
2. Deploy schema: run `hajri-admin/CLEAN-SCHEMA.sql` in Supabase
3. Finalize mobile responsiveness for Timetable

**Definition of “done” for this milestone**
- [x] Can login as admin
- [x] Can create offerings with search/filter
- [x] Can paint timetable in Draft (with Lab support)
- [x] Can publish and view Published timetable

---

## 🚨 Immediate Blockers (P0)

### 1. Dev Server Build Errors
**Status:** ✅ Resolved  
**Issue:** `npm run dev` was exiting with code 1  
**Resolution:** Fixed imports and dependencies.

---

### 2. Schema Deployment
**Status:** 🟡 Ready to Deploy  
**Issue:** CLEAN-SCHEMA.sql updated but not run in Supabase  
**Impact:** Frontend expects V2 tables but DB still has V1 or incomplete schema

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Run `hajri-admin/CLEAN-SCHEMA.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Verify `classes` and `batches` have `name` columns
- [ ] Verify `period_templates` has `slots` JSONB column

---

## ✨ Recent Improvements (Dec 26, 2025)

### 1. Timetable V2 Overhaul
- **Lab Support:** Automatic 2-hour slot merging for LAB type subjects.
- **Conflict Detection:** Real-time validation to prevent overlapping schedules.
- **Performance:** Replaced heavy Framer Motion animations with lightweight CSS transitions.
- **UI:** High-contrast color coding for LEC/LAB/TUT and cleaner grid layout.
- **Multiple Scheduling:** Removed gray-out effect - same subject can be scheduled multiple times per week with count badges.
- **Grid Overflow Fix:** Improved responsive grid layout to prevent label overflow.

### 2. Offerings Management
- **Search & Filter:** Added robust filtering by subject type and assignment status.
- **Stats:** Real-time counters for assigned vs pending offerings.
- **Enhanced Assignments Tab:** Added search bar, type filters (Theory/Lab/Tutorial), and status filters (Assigned/Pending/Not Created).

### 3. Academic Calendar
- **Data:** Integrated CHARUSAT 2025-26 academic calendar.
- **Timezone Fix:** Fixed UTC date shift bug - events now display on correct dates using local timezone formatting.

### 4. UI/UX Refinement
- **Overview:** Modernized stat cards and navigation tiles.
- **Theme:** Added success/warning/info semantic colors to Tailwind config.
- **Dark Theme:** Fixed color contrast issues with opacity-based backgrounds for visibility.

### 5. Security Fixes (NEW)
- **RLS Policies:** Added Row Level Security to 9 missing tables:
  - `semester_faculty`, `subject_components`, `offering_teachers`
  - `event_batches`, `event_rooms`, `faculty_constraints`
  - `batch_groups`, `batch_group_members`
- **Function Search Paths:** Fixed 9 functions with mutable search paths:
  - `get_current_lecture`, `cleanup_old_drafts`, `find_orphaned_offerings`
  - `is_teaching_day`, `count_teaching_days`, `check_room_conflict`
  - `check_faculty_conflict`, `update_updated_at_column`, `handle_new_user`
- **Migration File:** Created `sql-queries/migrations/05-security-fixes.sql`
- **Views:** Security Definer views kept intentionally for admin bypass functionality.
- [ ] Open Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Copy CLEAN-SCHEMA.sql contents
- [ ] Run entire script (drops + creates all tables)
- [ ] Verify all tables created:
  - `users`, `departments`, `semesters`, `subjects`, `faculty`, `rooms`, `batches`
  - `course_offerings`, `timetable_versions`, `timetable_events`
  - `period_templates`, `academic_calendar`
- [ ] Verify seed data inserted (default departments, semester, period template)
- [ ] Verify triggers/functions created (`handle_new_user`, `get_all_users`, `update_updated_at`)

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

**Priority:** P1 - Critical  
**Dependencies:** Build errors fixed, schema deployed

**Test Steps:**
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to Offerings page
3. Select batch → Create offering (subject + faculty + room)
4. Verify offering appears in table
5. Navigate to Timetable page
6. Select same batch
7. Select offering from palette
8. Drag-select cells
9. Click Apply
10. Verify events appear in grid
11. Switch to Published view (should be empty)
12. Switch back to Draft
13. Click Publish
14. Confirm publish action
15. Verify view switches to Published
16. Verify events visible in Published view
17. Switch back to Draft
18. Verify new empty draft created

**Expected Outcome:** End-to-end workflow completes without errors

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour (including bug fixes)

---

### 2. Fix Known UI Issues
**Priority:** P2 - High

**Issues:**
- [ ] Room override not implemented (always uses offering default)
- [ ] Selection doesn't clear on batch change
- [ ] No loading state during publish action
- [ ] No success toast after publish
- [ ] Period template dropdown (future: allow switching templates)

**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

---

### 3. UX Consistency Pass
**Priority:** P2 - High  
**Goal:** Convert all pages to shadcn-style components

**Pages to Update:**
- [ ] `Students.jsx` - Convert to Card/Table/Button pattern
- [ ] `Semesters.jsx` - Convert to Card/Table/Button pattern
- [ ] `Faculty.jsx` - Convert to Card/Table/Button pattern
- [ ] `Rooms.jsx` - Convert to Card/Table/Button pattern
- [ ] `Subjects.jsx` - Review and polish (already decent)
- [ ] `Dashboard.jsx` - Add stats cards or welcome content

**Reference:** Use `Subjects.jsx` and `OfferingsNew.jsx` as templates

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

---

## 🔧 Medium-Term Goals (Next 2 Weeks)

### 4. Timetable Productivity Features
**Priority:** P2 - High  
**User Request:** "Copy/paste, faster creation"

**Features:**
- [ ] **Copy Selection:** Ctrl+C or Copy button
  - Store selected cells + offering_id in clipboard state
- [ ] **Paste Selection:** Ctrl+V or Paste button
  - Apply clipboard offering to new selection
  - Enables "repeat pattern" workflow
- [ ] **Clear All (Batch):** Clear entire timetable for batch
- [ ] **Duplicate Day:** Copy Monday → Tuesday (mirror pattern)
- [ ] **Templates:** Save timetable as template, apply to other batches
- [ ] **Undo/Redo:** Stack-based undo for draft edits (before publish)

**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours

---

### 5. Room Override in Timetable
**Priority:** P2 - High  
**Current Behavior:** Events always use offering's default_room_id  
**Desired Behavior:** Admin can override room per event

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add room dropdown to cell on hover/click (edit mode)
- [ ] Update `timetable_events.room_id` on change
- [ ] Display override room (if set) or default room in cell
- [ ] Add "Clear Room Override" option (set room_id to NULL)

**UI Mockup:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ CS101 Data Structures   │
│ Dr. Smith               │
│ Room: [Lab 101 ▼]       │  ← Dropdown for override
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

---

### 6. Conflict Detection
**Priority:** P3 - Medium  
**Goal:** Warn admins of scheduling conflicts

**Types of Conflicts:**
- **Faculty Double-Booking:** Same faculty, same time, different batches
- **Room Double-Booking:** Same room, same time, different batches
- **Offering Overlap:** Same offering scheduled twice in same timetable

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add conflict detection queries (run on Apply)
- [ ] Show warning modal before upsert (allow force)
- [ ] Highlight conflicting cells in red
- [ ] Add "Conflicts" panel showing all conflicts in draft

**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours

---

### 7. Batch Management Page
**Priority:** P3 - Medium  
**Current State:** Batches created implicitly or via Offerings  
**Desired State:** Dedicated CRUD page for batches

**Features:**
- [ ] Create batch (name + department + semester)
- [ ] Edit batch
- [ ] Delete batch (cascade to offerings/timetables)
- [ ] List all batches with filters
- [ ] Search by name/department

**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Goals (Next Month)

**Features:**
- [ ] UI to create/edit academic calendar
- [ ] Define holidays, exam weeks, semester boundaries
- [ ] Calculate expected classes per subject (total weeks × classes/week)
- [ ] (Future) Compare with actual attendance

**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours

---

### 9. Reports & Analytics
**Priority:** P3 - Medium

**Reports:**
- [ ] **Faculty Workload:** Total hours per faculty across all batches

- `GET /subjects` (public read)
- `GET /batches` (public read)

**Mobile App Features:**
- Daily view of classes
- Weekly grid view
- Search by subject/faculty
- Push notifications before class
- Offline sync

**Estimated Time:** 12-15 hours (mobile app development)

---

### 11. Multi-Tenant Support
**Priority:** P4 - Future

**Use Case:** Support multiple institutions in single deployment

**Schema Changes:**
- [ ] Add `organizations` table
- [ ] Add `org_id` column to all domain tables

## 🐛 Known Bugs & Technical Debt

### Bugs (P2)
- [ ] Selection state not cleared when switching batches
- [ ] Draft version not cleaned up if batch deleted
- [ ] No validation for overlapping time slots (e.g., 09:00-11:00 conflicts with 10:00-12:00)
- [ ] Published button shows "No published yet" tooltip even when published exists (edge case)

### Technical Debt (P3)
- [ ] No tests (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] No CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] No error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] No analytics (Posthog)
- [ ] Hardcoded time slots (should load from period_templates everywhere)
- [ ] No pagination on large tables (Students, Offerings)
- [ ] No debouncing on search inputs
- [ ] No code splitting (all routes loaded upfront)

### Security Review (P2)
- [ ] Audit all RLS policies (ensure no leaks)
- [ ] Review SECURITY DEFINER functions (minimize privilege)
- [ ] Add rate limiting (Supabase Edge Functions?)
- [ ] Add CSRF protection (Supabase handles this?)
- [ ] Audit XSS risks (React escapes by default, verify JSONB)

- None (all required deps installed)

### Short-Term (P2)
- `react-hot-toast` - Toast notifications
- `date-fns` - Date formatting/manipulation
- `@tanstack/react-query` - Server state management (optional, improves caching)

### Medium-Term (P3)
- `jspdf` + `jspdf-autotable` - PDF export
- `papaparse` - CSV export/import
- `recharts` or `chart.js` - Reports/analytics charts

### Long-Term (P4)

---

## 🔄 Migration Strategy (V1 → V2)

### If Existing Data in V1 Schema

**Option A: Fresh Start (Recommended)**
- Run CLEAN-SCHEMA.sql (drops all tables)
- Re-enter departments, subjects, faculty, rooms
- Create offerings from scratch
- Build timetables in V2 editor

**Option B: Data Migration**
- Write migration script:
  1. Export V1 `timetable_entries`
  2. Create matching `course_offerings` (deduplicate subject+batch+faculty)
  3. Create `timetable_versions` (one published per batch)
  4. Convert `timetable_entries` → `timetable_events` (link to offerings)
- Estimated Time: 4-6 hours (script + testing)

**Option C: Dual Schema (Not Recommended)**
- Keep both `timetable_entries` and `timetable_events`
- Sync changes between them
- Complexity: High, maintenance burden

**Decision:** Fresh start for pilot, migration script for production (if needed)

1 ) You are a senior frontend architect.

TASK:
Refactor the existing Tree Explorer so it behaves like a Discord / VS Code sidebar.

REQUIREMENTS (STRICT):
- Tree Explorer is the ONLY sidebar.
- Default width: 260px
- Min width: 200px
- Max width: 360px
- Resizable by dragging right edge (cursor: col-resize)
- Double-click resize handle resets to default width
- Collapsible into icon-only rail (48–56px)
- Collapse/expand state must persist (localStorage)
- Width must persist (localStorage)

UX RULES:
- Tree controls global scope
- Tree never renders inside page content
- Main content must flex smoothly (no layout jump)
- Transition duration: 120–150ms ease-out
- No opacity animation on main content

DO NOT:
- Add a traditional sidebar
- Duplicate navigation
- Add scope selectors elsewhere

OUTPUT:
Explain the component responsibilities and layout behavior.
Do NOT redesign visuals. Focus on behavior and architecture.





2)You are designing a global scope architecture for a tree-driven admin UI.

TASK:
Define a SINGLE source of truth for scope, controlled ONLY by the Tree Explorer.

SCOPE MODEL:
- departmentId
- branchId
- semesterId
- classId
- batchId
- level (department | branch | semester | class | batch)

RULES:
- Tree updates scope
- Pages consume scope (read-only)
- Pages NEVER modify scope
- Lower levels imply higher levels
- Scope change invalidates all data queries

INTEGRATION:
- Designed for Zustand (global UI state)
- Data fetching via TanStack Query
- Queries must always be scoped

OUTPUT:
1. Scope lifecycle (tree click → UI update)
2. Rules for partial scope (e.g. semester selected, no class)
3. How pages should guard against missing scope

DO NOT:
- Add dropdowns
- Add fallback guessing
- Allow multiple scope setters


3) You are fixing a broken Overview page in a scope-driven admin UI.

TASK:
Redesign Overview so it reacts dynamically to the current scope.

RULE:
Overview content MUST change based on scope.level.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- No scope selected → show “Select a node from the tree”
- Department → show branches & semesters count
- Branch → show semesters & active semesters
- Semester → show classes, subjects count
- Class → show batches, assignments
- Batch → show timetable status (draft/published)

UX RULES:
- No forms
- No global metrics
- No scope selectors
- Overview is read-only

OUTPUT:
Explain conditional rendering logic based on scope.level.
No code. No visuals.


4)You are auditing a dark-mode admin UI with inconsistent colors.

TASK:
Normalize the color system and eliminate accidental light surfaces.

BASE PALETTE (LOCK THIS):
- App background: #0B0F1A
- Sidebar: #0F172A
- Surface: #111827
- Card: #0F172A
- Primary: #3B82F6
- Success: #22C55E
- Warning: #F59E0B
- Error: #EF4444
- Text primary: #E5E7EB
- Text muted: #9CA3AF

RULES:
- No bg-white anywhere
- Cards slightly lighter than background
- Sidebar darker than content
- Tabs must not look disabled when active

STACK:
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- CSS variables allowed

OUTPUT:
1. Surface hierarchy rules
2. Common mistakes to remove (bg-white, bg-background)
3. How to prevent contrast noise

DO NOT redesign layout.


5) You are rebuilding a timetable UI for an academic admin system.

IMPORTANT:
The existing AI-generated timetable UX is WRONG.
You must discard it.

TASK:
Design a canvas-first timetable interaction model.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Scope = Batch (from tree)
- Grid = days × time slots
- Offerings are draggable items
- Grid cells are droppable targets
- Drag → slot highlights
- Drop → immediate placement
- Click block → edit room / faculty
- No “Apply” button for basic actions

ROOM HANDLING:
- Room is selected at drop time
- Room is NOT part of offering
- Validate room conflicts immediately

TECH:
- @dnd-kit
- No react-beautiful-dnd
- Grid treated as canvas, not table

OUTPUT:
1. Interaction flow (drag → drop → edit)
2. Why this UX works for admins
3. Rules that prevent silent conflicts

NO CODE.
NO FORMS.
NO STATIC TABLE UX.

6)You are designing a scalable admin UI with potentially large datasets.

TASK:
Define filtering, virtualization, and performance rules.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Tree scope limits data
- No global lists rendered
- All queries scoped
- TanStack Query for caching
- TanStack Table for large tables
- Search always scoped

OUTPUT:
1. Data loading rules per page
2. How to prevent scroll explosion
3. UX indicators for incomplete setup

DO NOT suggest pagination everywhere blindly.
